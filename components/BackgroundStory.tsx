            Wephco was founded with a vision to bridge Africa’s rising wealth with the world’s most prestigious property markets. Headquartered in Nigeria, we began as a boutique brokerage serving discerning clients seeking secure and profitable investments abroad. Over time, Wephco evolved into a trusted global partner, providing tailored access to rare assets across the UAE, UK, Monaco, USA, Turkey, and Australia.

            Rooted in African excellence and guided by global expertise, Wephco has built its reputation on discretion, trust, and exclusivity. Today, we stand not just as brokers of property, but as advisors of legacy — helping investors preserve wealth, expand influence, and create intergenerational security through strategic international real estate acquisitions.
